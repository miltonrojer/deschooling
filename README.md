## Deschooling Society vision
A good educational system should have three purposes: it should provide all who want to learn with access to available resources at any time in their lives;
empower all who want to share what they know to find those who want to learn it from them; and, finally,
furnish all who want to present an issue to the public with the opportunity to make their challenge known.

The operation of a peer-matching network would be simple.
The user would identify himself by name and address and describe the activity for which he sought a peer.
A computer would send him back the names and addresses of all those who had inserted the same description.
It is amazing that such a simple utility has never been used on a broad scale for publicly valued activity.
*Ivan Illich*
